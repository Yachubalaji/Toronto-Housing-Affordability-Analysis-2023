Toronto-Housing-Affordability-Analysis-2023 : [https://smuhalifax.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/media/index.html?appid=9ad6df40e8c34cd08c99fbffbd96161f]


Overview
This repository hosts an in-depth analysis of Toronto's housing affordability in 2023, leveraging ArcGIS to visualize and interpret the intricate relationship between housing data and population density. Our primary goal is to uncover insights into the city's housing affordability, providing a comprehensive overview that informs both policymakers and the public.

Data Sources
The analysis is based on two key datasets:

Toronto Housing Data (2023): Detailed records encompassing various aspects of housing, including prices, types, and ownership rates across different neighborhoods.
Toronto Population Density (2023): Geospatial data representing population density metrics, crucial for understanding housing demand pressures across the city.
Objectives
Spatial Analysis: Utilize ArcGIS capabilities to map and analyze the spatial distribution of housing prices and population density.
Affordability Insights: Assess the affordability of housing by correlating housing prices with population density and other socioeconomic indicators.
Trend Identification: Identify areas with significant changes in housing affordability and predict future trends.

Datasets
The analysis incorporates several key datasets:

Hot Spots Total Residential Unit
Neighbourhoods Fields
Neighbourhoods - 4326
Summarize Toronto Community Housing within Toronto Affordability Layer MH
Toronto Affordability Layer MH
Toronto Community Housing Density
Toronto Neighbourhood Demographic MH
Toronto Neighbourhood MH
These datasets are included as part of this project and are crucial for conducting a comprehensive analysis of housing affordability in Toronto.

Installation and Usage
To use these datasets and perform your analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure you have ArcGIS or a compatible GIS software installed.
Download the datasets from this repository.
Load the datasets into your GIS software.
Follow the analysis procedures outlined in the Analysis_Methods.md document (to be prepared by the user, detailing the methods used in the analysis).
Methodology
Our methodology involves spatial analysis to understand the geographical distribution of housing affordability across Toronto. This includes mapping residential units, analyzing community housing density, and correlating these factors with population density and demographic information. The objective is to identify patterns, trends, and areas where housing affordability is a pressing concern.

Results
The results section (to be updated upon completion of the analysis) will contain findings, maps, and charts derived from our analysis. This will include insights into areas with significant affordability issues, trends in housing affordability over the past year, and potential future developments.
